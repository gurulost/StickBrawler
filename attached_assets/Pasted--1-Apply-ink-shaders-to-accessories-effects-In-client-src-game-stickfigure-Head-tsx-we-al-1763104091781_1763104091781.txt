  1. Apply ink shaders to accessories/effects
      - In client/src/game/stickfigure/Head.tsx, we already switched the base meshes to useInkMaterial.
        Extend that to each accessory mesh: replace every meshStandardMaterial block with useInkMaterial plus
        useOutlineMaterial, using accessory-specific colors (accessory.color, accessory.rimColor, etc.).
      - Do the same for body accessories (cape, swords, shields) wherever they’re mounted (currently in Head.tsx;
        future pass for StickFigure decorations). If an accessory uses planeGeometry (capes, wings), ensure the
        shader handles double-sided rendering (side: THREE.DoubleSide).
  2. Extend accessory definitions
      - Update client/src/lib/stores/useCustomization.tsx accessory entries to include ink-specific params
        (rimColor, lineWidth, outlineColor, shadeBands, glow). This lets the shader pick up unique looks per
        accessory.
  3. Fallback material
      - Add a useControls or useFighting flag (e.g., settings.lowGraphics) and provide a fallback MeshStandard
        material if that flag is set. useInkMaterial should check the flag and return a basic material to avoid
        shader cost on low-end devices.
  4. Customization UI
      - Update fighter-customizer (client/src/components/ui/fighter-customizer.tsx) so players see silhouette
        presets (the new outlineWidth + silhouette data). Add preview thumbnails or at least textual descriptions
        for “ink styles.”
      - Offer toggle/slider for outline weight and curvature overrides so advanced users can tweak beyond
        presets.
  5. QA & Docs
      - Run npm run check && npm test once the toolchain is ready to ensure TS/types stay solid.
      - Playtest across all figure styles/accessories with pauses, telemetry, and multiplayer to confirm
        determinism/performance.
      - Update docs/screenshots (maybe in docs/ or ROADMAP.md) showcasing the new ink look and customization
        panel.
  6. Optional stretch
      - If time allows, propagate the ink shader to VFX meshes (dust, trails) for consistency.
      - Add analytics hooks to store which silhouette/accessory combos players pick, using the existing telemetry
        infrastructure.

  With these steps, the next developer can finish the ink treatment and truly unlock the customization system.
