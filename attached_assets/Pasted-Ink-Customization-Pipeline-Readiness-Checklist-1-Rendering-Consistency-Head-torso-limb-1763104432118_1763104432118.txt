Ink Customization Pipeline Readiness Checklist

  1. Rendering Consistency
      - Head, torso, limbs, and every accessory mesh (including multi-part ones like wings) use useInkMaterial
        + useOutlineMaterial.
      - Outline scaling respects each figure style’s outlineWidth.
      - All VFX/decoration meshes that sit on the fighters (scarves, capes) render in the same toon style
        (double-sided where needed).
  2. Customization Data & UI
      - figureStyles expose silhouette params (silhouette.arms/legs, outlineWidth, etc.) and the fighter
        customizer surfaces these choices (previews or at least clear labels).
      - Accessories in useCustomization.tsx include ink-specific fields (color, rimColor, outlineColor,
        lineWidth, shadeBands, glow), and the UI lets players pick them.
      - Player presets (saved characters) persist these new parameters end-to-end (load/save works).
  3. Fallback / Performance Modes
      - There’s a user-facing toggle (settings or auto-detect) that forces simple MeshStandard materials for low-
        end hardware, and it’s plumbed through StickFigure.
      - Profiling confirms the toon pipeline fits performance budgets on target hardware (documented thresholds/
        FPS).
  4. Determinism & Multiplayer
      - The ink pipeline doesn’t introduce per-frame randomness; silhouettes and shading are entirely driven by
        deterministic state (no Math.random() outside initial seeds).
      - Multiplayer (lobby → fight → pause) works identically whether players use default or customized
        silhouettes/accessories.
  5. QA & Regression
      - npm run check && npm test pass locally with the new customization fields.
      - Visual QA covers:
          - Each figure style + accessory combination renders without shader artifacts.
          - Pause/resume, guard breaks, hitlag effects still behave as before.
          - Telemetry and replays (if any) remain valid.
  6. Docs & Debugging Aids
      - stylized_plan.md (or similar doc) updated with instructions on how to extend silhouettes/accessories.
      - Debug toggles exist (e.g., show control points/outline widths) to help future tuning.
      - Screenshots/GIFs captured for internal reference showing ink look across multiple styles.
